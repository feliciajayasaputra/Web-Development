# TODOApp

In this class we will be building a simple TODO application, a very common introductory web application.  We will
be using a slew of technologies to achieve this: Python, Flask, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, Redis, PeeweeORM & RQ Job
Queue.

The project will be split into two sections.

In the first section you will be copying me as I build out a basic TODO app, and then enhance it with htmx.  This will
be done individually.

In the second section you will split into groups of 3 and design and implement a new piece of functionality for the
application as a group.  

Here are some suggested features:

* Implement a login and per-user TODO lists
* Implement AI-based TODO suggestions
* Implement due dates + a warning system for TODO items
* Implement "tags" for TODOs and allow filtering
* Implement nested TODOs, where TODOs can contain other TODOs

Multiple groups can implement the same features, although I would prefer each group do something unique.

At the end of the course each group will give a demonstration of their feature and then a walk-through the code for it.

## Grading

Since this is the first time I'm doing this class and this approach to a project, the grading is going to be very
lenient as we work out the kinks.  I expect everyone will get 100% on the first part, so long as they faithfully copy
down my code.

The second part may have a bit more variation, but again I expect most teams to do well on it.

### First Checkpoint

For the first checkpoint you will need to record a demo of the following:

* Adding a TODO
* Marking a TODO complete
* Deleting a TODO
* Viewing only incomplete TODOs
* Viewing only complete TODOs
* Reordering TODOs

I suggest you use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to record the demo, and then submit it as an MP4 in D2L.

I will also inspect your repo to ensure you properly implemented the app.

### Second Checkpoint

For the second checkpoint each group will give a short presentation (<10 minutes) of their feature as well as a 
walk-through of the code

We will have a vote for the best feature of the class, that team will recieve free copies of "Hypermedia Systems" from
me.
