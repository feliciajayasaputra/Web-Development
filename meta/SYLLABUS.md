# CSCI 491-7: Advanced Web Development

_3 Credits. (3 Lec) S_

## Overview

CS491 is designed to give you a deep understanding of web technologies:

* How the fundamental architecture of the web was designed
* The core conceptual ideas of hypermedia
* The practical tools available in web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Integrating a web application with a relational database

In the class we will be building a TODO application together, first using traditional 
web technologies, and then enhanced with more modern technologies such as [htmx](https://htmx.org).

Students will be grouped into teams of 3 and will design and add a feature to the TODO app.

## Logistics

### Lectures

Lectures are at 1:40-2:55PM, Tuesday & Thursday in AIH 166. 

Rather than a midterm or final, the class will have quizzes three weeks, beginning the third
week. The quizzes will be available online via D2L, and we will not have in-person classes on those days.

All lectures will be live-streamed via YouTube.

There is an active Discord for the server, a link to join can be found on the content tab in D2L.

### Office Hours

Office hours are Tuesday & Thursday, 3:00-4:30PM in the Student Success Center, Barnard Hall 254.
